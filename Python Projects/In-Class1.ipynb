    "Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and **object-oriented** approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",

    "**Interpreted vs Compiled** - Interpreted language will usually require some sort of instance of the program's language to run. The result is the result of the program itself. Compiled languages will need some sort of compiler and the output is usually an executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level vs low-level** - High-level languages are languages that are usually considered to be closer to human language. The traditional trade off is that high-level languages are easier to read, script, learn but are a lot slower than low-level languages. Examples: Python, Julia, MATLAB, R, and Visual Basic, C. Low-level languages are closer to machine language and are often harder to learn and program with but have a significant increase in performance. One of the only true low-level languages is assembly(essentially the languages that computers read and understand). However, depending on your background, you may also consider C, C++, and FORTRAN to be low-level as well.\n",

There are also prohibitions such as starting a variable name with a number (e.g. 2b = \"or not to be\"), using white space in the name (e.g. my account = 88888), or using a reserved word (e.g. str = \"hello\").
